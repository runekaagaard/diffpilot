NAME
       diffpilot - intelligent Git diff visualization with file grouping

SYNOPSIS
       diffpilot [OPTIONS] path/to/git/project

DESCRIPTION
       Diffpilot serves a local web interface for viewing git diffs across multiple
       columns on large monitors. Files can be grouped and sorted based on patterns
       and priorities, and tagged for better overview. All configuration is done in
       the diffpilot.yaml file in your git repository.

OPTIONS
       -p, --port=NUMBER
              Specify the port number for the web server (default: 3333)

       -n, --interval=SECONDS
              Refresh interval in seconds, can be fractional (default: 2.0)

       --diff-command=COMMAND
              Custom diff command (default: "git diff --color=never")
              Example: --diff-command="git diff master...HEAD"
              Example: --diff-command="git diff --cached"

       --diff-local
              Shows comprehensive local changes, including:
              - Untracked files not yet added to git
              - Modified tracked files in the working directory
              - Staged changes ready to be committed
              - Uncommitted changes in tracked files
              Runs two separate git commands:
              1. Show diffs for untracked files
              2. Show diffs for tracked changes in working directory and staging area

       --diff-branch=BRANCH
              Shows comprehensive changes in current branch compared to specified branch:
              - Untracked files not yet added to git
              - Modified tracked files in the working directory
              - Staged changes ready to be committed
              - Uncommitted changes in tracked files
              - All differences since the branch diverged from the specified branch
              Runs two separate git commands:
              1. Show diffs for untracked files
              2. Show diffs compared to the branch's divergence point

       --window-title=TITLE
              Set custom window title (default: Diffpilot)

       -h, --help
              Display help information and exit

       --no-open
              Don't automatically open browser window on startup

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file (diffpilot.yaml) uses YAML format with two main 
       sections: file_groups and tags.

       FILE GROUP MATCHING
       When multiple file groups match a file, the FIRST matching group in the 
       configuration file will be used for priority, and tags. 
       Order your file groups from most specific to most general.

       file_groups:
              List of group definitions containing:
              - title: Group display name
              - glob: File matching pattern
              - priority: Sort order (higher numbers first)
              - tags: Array of tag names

       tags:
              Tag definitions containing:
              - css_class: CSS class name for styling

       extra_css:
              Optional path to additional CSS file

TAG STYLING
       Tags are rendered as Bootstrap badges. Each tag has a default 'badge' class
       and can be customized with additional classes or through custom CSS. For
       available badge styles see the Badges section at 
       https://bootswatch.com/flatly/

EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION
       file_groups:
         - title: "Django Models"
           glob: "*/models.py"
           priority: 10
           tags: [models, python, core]
         - title: "Tests"
           glob: "*/tests/*.py"
           priority: 8
           tags: [tests, python]

       tags:
         models:
           css_class: "bg-primary"        # Uses Bootstrap's primary background
         python:
           css_class: "custom-python"     # Class from custom CSS file

       extra_css: "./diffpilot.css"

GLOB PATTERNS
       Supports standard glob patterns:
       *        Matches any characters except /
       **       Matches any characters including /
       ?        Matches single character
       [abc]    Matches one character in brackets

EXAMPLES
       Start server for current git project:
              $ diffpilot .

       Show local changes:
              $ diffpilot . --diff-local

       Compare with main branch:
              $ diffpilot . --diff-branch main

       Start with 5 second refresh:
              $ diffpilot -n 5 .

       Start on specific port:
              $ diffpilot -p 8080 /path/to/project

       Show staged changes:
              $ diffpilot . --diff-command="git diff --cached"

       Set custom window title:
              $ diffpilot . --window-title "My Project Diffs"
